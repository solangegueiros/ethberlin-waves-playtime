# Playtime at waves platform
# ethberlinzwei 2019

## Description
My project at Hackaton EthBerlin 2019

A two user bet game using ride programming language at waves platform 

## Inspiration
To learn new things

## What it does
It is a game for two players.

One player wins when his bet is equal or greater than 2 times the other bet.

## How I built it
I use Visual Studio Code.

I did the scripts using ride programming language.

I tested with surfboard.

## Challenges I ran into
It was very difficult because the programming language is so diferent and I do no have much base on the concepts.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I almost gave up because I couldn't even change the basic example and didn't have dawn support. But I insisted and finished my idea.

## What I learned
I learned ride programming language and the basic at waves platform.

## What's next
I would like to do more tests and a frontend.
